# Fix Compilation Errors

## ✅ Fixed: WidgetDebugManager Reference

I've removed the WidgetDebugManager reference from SupabaseManager.swift since it was causing compilation errors.

## 📝 Optional: Add Debug Tools

If you want to use the advanced debugging tools, you can optionally add them to your project:

### Add WidgetDebugManager (Optional):
1. Right-click on `Managers` folder in Xcode
2. Select "Add Files to 'SidebarApp'..."
3. Navigate to `SidebarApp/Managers/`
4. Select `WidgetDebugManager.swift`
5. Make sure **only** "SidebarApp" target is checked (NOT the widget)
6. Click "Add"

### Add WidgetDebugView (Optional):
1. Right-click on `Views` folder in Xcode
2. Select "Add Files to 'SidebarApp'..."
3. Navigate to `SidebarApp/Views/`
4. Select `WidgetDebugView.swift`
5. Make sure **only** "SidebarApp" target is checked (NOT the widget)
6. Click "Add"

## ✅ What's Working Now

The core authentication and widget sync functionality works without these debug tools. The debug tools are just helpers for troubleshooting if needed.

Your app should now:
1. Build without errors
2. Properly sync authentication state to the widget
3. Show user promises in the widget when authenticated

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Clean build folder (⇧⌘K)
2. Build and run
3. Sign in and check if widget shows authenticated state
4. If issues persist, optionally add the debug tools above
