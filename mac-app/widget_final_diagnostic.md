# Widget Diagnostic Summary

## Issue
The widget is showing "Open App" instead of displaying promises, even though:
1. Authentication state is properly saved (`isAuthenticated: true`)
2. Promise data exists (4 promises in the data file)
3. The data file has correct permissions

## Root Cause
The widget was getting a permission error when trying to read the `widget_data.json` file due to file protection attributes. This has been fixed by:
1. Removing `.completeFileProtection` from file write operations
2. Setting file protection to `.none` after writing
3. Ensuring the widget has proper entitlements

## What Was Fixed

### 1. File Protection (UnifiedSharedDataManager.swift)
- Removed `.completeFileProtection` from file write options
- Added explicit removal of file protection attributes after saving
- Fixed directory creation to not use protection attributes

### 2. Widget View Logic (PromiseWidget.swift)
- Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Added proper state handling for authenticated users with no promises
- Added fallback to sample data for debugging

### 3. Data Sync
- Verified data is being properly synced from main app
- Both legacy (UserDefaults) and new (file-based) storage are working
- Authentication state is preserved with "never downgrade" logic

## Current Status
- ✅ Authentication state is correctly saved
- ✅ Promise data is being written to shared storage
- ✅ File permissions have been fixed
- ✅ Widget has proper app group entitlements
- ⚠️ Widget may need to be removed and re-added to pick up changes

## Next Steps for User

1. **Remove and re-add the widget**:
   - Right-click on the widget and select "Remove Widget"
   - Add it back from the widget gallery

2. **If still not working, check Console logs**:
   - Open Console.app
   - Filter by "PromiseWidget"
   - Look for any permission or decoding errors

3. **Force a data refresh**:
   - Open the main app
   - Make any change to a promise (add/edit/delete)
   - This will trigger a fresh data sync

4. **As a last resort**:
   - Restart the Mac to clear any cached widget state
   - The widget extension process may be holding onto old file handles

## Technical Details

The widget data is stored at:
```
/Users/anaygupta/Library/Group Containers/group.TX645N2QBW.com.example.mac.SidebarApp/WidgetData/widget_data.json
```

Current data shows:
- isAuthenticated: true
- userId: 932376A3-57F8-46F7-A38D-6696F29B9ADC
- userEmail: rahult@vt.edu
- promises: 4 items
