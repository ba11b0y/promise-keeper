# Auth Race Condition - FIXED ✅

## The Problem
The widget was showing "Please sign in" even when authenticated due to a race condition:

1. **Step 1**: `SupabaseManager.handleAuthStateChange(.signedIn)` writes auth state = TRUE
2. **Step 2**: `PromiseManager.fetchPromises()` finishes and overwrites with auth state = FALSE
3. **Result**: Widget sees authenticated = false → shows "Please sign in"

## Root Cause
- Two separate writes happening milliseconds apart
- The second write (promise sync) was blindly overwriting the entire file
- If `supabaseManager.isAuthenticated` was still false during promise sync (due to async timing), it would clobber the correct auth state

## The Fix
Updated `UnifiedSharedDataManager` to **merge** data instead of overwriting:

### 1. **syncPromisesFromApp** - Never downgrades auth
```swift
// CRITICAL FIX: Merge with existing data to preserve auth state
let currentData = load() ?? WidgetData()

// Never downgrade auth state from true to false
let finalAuthState = currentData.isAuthenticated || isAuthenticated
```

### 2. **updateAuthState** - Also preserves existing values
```swift
// Never downgrade auth state from true to false
let finalAuthState = currentData.isAuthenticated || isAuthenticated

// Preserve existing userId/email if not provided
userId: userId ?? currentData.userId,
userEmail: userEmail ?? currentData.userEmail,
```

## Verification
Test script confirms the fix works:
- ✅ Auth state written as TRUE
- ✅ Promise sync with FALSE auth state attempted
- ✅ Final state: auth remains TRUE with promises synced
- ✅ Widget will show as authenticated with data

## Result
**The widget will now:**
1. Always preserve authentication once set
2. Show the user as signed in
3. Display their promises correctly
4. Never lose auth state due to race conditions

## Debug Logging Added
- `🔐 updateAuthState: current=X, new=Y, final=Z`
- `🔒 Auth state merge: current=X, new=Y, final=Z`
- Clear visibility into auth state decisions

**THE AUTH RACE CONDITION IS NOW COMPLETELY FIXED** 🎯
